# Product Roadmap

This roadmap contains all the tweaks, improvements and new features we plan for UseSQL. Of course, things change and we may shuffle priorities at any time. At UseSQL we learn A TON from talking to users, so don't hesitate to contact us with your ideas and feedback.

Check the out [Roadmap for UseSQL](https://github.com/usesql/roadmap/projects/1) for an overview.

Note: not all small updates and features will be tracked here; we regularly make small updates based on private feedback or our own discoveries and we'd rather ship them than create and close tickets here.
